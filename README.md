## How It Works

### Methodology

Rift Rewind follows a data-driven coaching philosophy inspired by elite League of Legends coaching:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches full-year match history via Riot Games API
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Processes match data to extract:
   - CS/min, KDA, vision scores, objective participation
   - Champion pool performance metrics
   - Role-specific statistics
   - Final item build patterns
3. **Benchmark Comparison**: Compares player metrics against role and elo-specific benchmarks
4. **AI Analysis**: Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet) generates personalized coaching insights using a structured prompt that includes:
   - Player statistics and benchmarks
   - Champion pool data
   - Item build analysis
   - Role-specific recommendations
5. **Insight Presentation**: Insights are parsed and displayed in an interactive Bento Grid UI

### Key Discoveries

- **Cost-Effective AI**: Using Claude 3 Sonnet on Bedrock provides high-quality analysis at a fraction of the cost of GPT-4
- **Structured Prompts**: Carefully crafted prompt templates ensure consistent, actionable output
- **Data Quality Matters**: Processing match timelines for item snapshots adds valuable context
